			Personal Website
		</h2>
		<p>I’ve always wanted a personal website and now I finally have one.</p>
		<p>
			This site is built from the ground up with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			It’s fully responsive and automatically adapts to your system’s light or
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-on-dark_color_scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark
				mode</a> preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Updates are fully automated: <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a> build
			the site into a Docker image and publishes it to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
			The image is then deployed to a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener">VPS</a>,
			where it runs behind a reverse proxy to ensure fast and secure access.
